In this study, we collected nineteen hippocampus samples from HS patients to generate snRNA-seq profiles. Four public human single-nucleus data of control hippocampus samples obtained from the GEO database (GSE163737) were integrated and analyzed together with our data. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Xuanwu Hospital (LYS[2021]118), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their guardians prior to surgery.
